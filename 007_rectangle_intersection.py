"""

Write a function to find the rectangular intersection of two given rectangles.

Rectangles are always "straight" and never "diagonal." More rigorously: each 
side is parallel with either the x-axis or the y-axis.

They are defined as dictionaries â†´ like this:

my_rectangle = {
    'left_x': 1,
    'bottom_y': 5,
    'width': 10,
    'height': 4,
}

Your output rectangle should use this format as well.
