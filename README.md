Structure
---------

This project is kept as simple as possible.
The responses to problems exist in the 'exercises' directory, tests in the 'test' directory


Running Tests
--------------

There's a testrunner file to run all tests

	python test.py

Individual test files can be run e.g.

	python test.py tests/test_highest_product_of.py


But that's it: Keep It Simple, Stupid!
